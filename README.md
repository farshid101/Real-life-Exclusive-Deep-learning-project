        <p>Cyber crime is a serious problem that is rapidly growing in today&apos;s world. It is defined as the use of technology to commit a crime or cause harm to an individual or group. It can involve the theft of personal information, the disruption of computer systems, or the spread of malicious software. Cybercriminals use a variety of tactics to commit their crimes, such as phishing, malware, and ransomware. These tactics can be used to steal confidential information, disrupt computer networks, or spread malicious software. Cyber crime is a global problem, as it affects individuals, businesses, and governments around the world. Victims of cyber crime may suffer financial losses, identity theft, or the exposure of confidential information. In addition, cyber criminals can use malware and ransomware to hold computers or data hostage. This type of attack can be extremely disruptive, as the victim is unable to access their devices or data until a ransom is paid. Cyber crime is a growing threat, and it is important for individuals, businesses, and governments to take steps to protect themselves. This includes using strong passwords, installing antivirus software, and staying up to date on security patches. In addition, it is important to stay aware of the latest online threats and be cautious when sharing confidential information online .</p>
